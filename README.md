User flairs on r/soccer


IN PROGRESS

I am doing some exploratory analysis and data visualization of user flairs on the subreddit, r/soccer. Flairs are little badges a user 
can have beside their username to show which team they support.

Flairs are a way of communicating to other Reddit users where you stand, giving context to your comment. It removes the need for each 
individual to type "_I support x team, btw_" or "_As a x fan, ..._" 

Using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), The Python Reddit API Wrapper, I extracted information about posts and comments 
and answered questions I was curious about.
